Charlotte   Nick who? Oh, Sarah's neighbor Nick?
Samantha    Yeah, that Nick.
Charlotte   I ran into him a couple of days ago, but he was in a hurry, so we didn't talk.
Samantha    Did he tell you where he was going?
Charlotte   No, he didn't, and I don't usually ask him where he is going, either.
Samantha    Hmm. I wonder where he is now, and what he is doing.
Charlotte   Wait, I don't understand why you care about his whereabouts.
     He has a girlfriend named Ashley, remember? Don't tell me you have a thing for him.
Samantha    Come on, Charlotte. Give me a break. I could never have a thing for a thief or any kind of criminal.
Charlotte   A criminal? What? I don't know what you are talking about.
